The project management and accounting module is like a new planet in Dynamics 365 finance and operations, but it's got a fleet of space shuttles connecting it to the rest of our system galaxy. The whole project-to-profit process is pretty big. It all kicks off in the **first business process area** where we deal with **project opportunities**, triggering the start of a project and the beginning of a pipeline.

From the moment a lead shows up until it turns into an opportunity, it's all handled in the sales and marketing module. In the relationships section of the module, we kick things off by **creating and managing contacts. These contacts help us create prospects, which eventually become leads**.

Once we've got a lead, we can keep its info updated and **go through the qualification process**. This is also where we can log all the activities related to the lead. And when the time is right you can update the status to indicate where it is in the sales process, if it makes sense, we can **qualify that lead and create an opportunity** or a customer account.

## Manage project opportunities

When a lead transforms into an opportunity, it **opens the door to capturing additional sales-related details throughout the sales process**, including competitor information and SWOT analysis.

In the management of your opportunities, you have the option to assign probability percentages and prognosis ratings to each opportunity. This allows you to closely follow the likelihood that the opportunity will convert into a project quotation.

After **creating and submitting your project quotes**, stay up-to-date on whether you secured the opportunity and what factors influenced the decision.

**We will begin managing project quotations as the second business process area in Project-to-profit.**
