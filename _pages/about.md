I have 6+ years of experience in ERP implementations. I have worked at myPartner, a Microsoft partner, and FARFETCH Group, a global platform for luxury.

First, I started by implementing NAV and later AX/F&O, the two Microsoft ERPs. The projects occurred in different locations, such as Portugal, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Brazil.

Presently I am a Dynamics 365 Finance Certified Functional Consultant at LS Retail.

I hold a B.Sc. in Business Administration from the school of Economics and Management of the University of Porto.
