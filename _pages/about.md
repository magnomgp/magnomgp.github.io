Hey there, I'm Magno, and I wear the hat of a Dynamics 365 Finance and SCM Certified Functional Consultant, and I'm also a Solution Architect Expert.

Think of my blog as a treasure chest where I share not only what I know but also the real-world moments and hurdles I encounter while diving into Dynamics 365 projects. There's no set schedule for my posts â€“ they pop up as I navigate through different aspects.

Feel like a chat? Catch me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/magnomgp). Let's journey through the Dynamics 365 realm together!
